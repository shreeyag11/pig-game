# PIG GAME! :pig:

## Gameplay:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

* Player needs set the winning score in the begining of the game.
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach the winning score or more points wins.
* If two consecutive 6 appears for a player then the **ENTIRE** score will be lost and it becomes the next player's turn.
